# vue-portfolio

## About 
This is my first Vue project ever. I wanted a portofolio site where i could display my work 
to different employers.

The project displays all my public repositories by using the github API. 
By doing this all future repositories will automatically be added on to this site.

## Technologies used
```
Vue
Javascript
